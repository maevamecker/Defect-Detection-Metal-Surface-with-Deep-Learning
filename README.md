# Defect-Detection-Metal-Surface-with-Deep-Learning

This [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/maevamecker/Defect-Detection-Metal-Surface-with-Deep-Learning/blob/master/.ipynb_checkpoints/ExampleNotebook-checkpoint.ipynb) presents an use case of applying neural networks to classify defects

In a huge number of industries the process of quality check for final product is not always reliable and prone to error when it is done by human. For this reason, we can use machine learning algorithms to detect and classify a defect on a surface. This system exists already in the automotive and aeronautic industry. Here we will use the algorithms to detect defaut on metallic surface. This model associated to a visual sensor could help to improve quality on the production line.

We have a dataset of 1800 images of steel surfaces. There are 6 possible defects, so we have 300 images of steel surfaces for each defect. The defect will be classify automaticaly by the algorithms to one of the folowing category:

- 0 which corresponds to "Crazing"
- 1 which corresponds to "Inclusions"
- 2 which corresponds to "Patches"
- 3 which corresponds to"Pitted Surface"
- 4 which corresponds to "Rolled in Scale"
- 5 which corresponds to "Scratches"
